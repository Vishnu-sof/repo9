        Today, almost all commercially available motorcycles are driven by
        conventional gasoline internal combustion engines, increasingly
        4-strokes in all size ranges. This is because 4 stroke engines are more
        fuel efficient, cause less emissions and have a longer life than
        2-stroke engines. In a 4-stroke engine, the working cycle is completed
        in 4-strokes of the piston or two revolutions of the crankshaft. This is
        achieved by carrying out suction, compression, expansion and exhaust
        processes in each stroke. The 4-strokes of a petrol engine sucking
        fuel-air mixture are described below. Suction or Charge Stroke: In this
        stroke, the inlet valve opens and a mixture of fuel and air is forced by
        atmospheric pressure into the cylinder through the intake port. The
        piston descends from the top of the cylinder to the bottom of the
        cylinder.
