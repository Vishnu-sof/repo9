        Modi was born and raised in Vadnagar in northeastern Gujarat, where he
        completed his secondary education. He was introduced to the RSS at the
        age of eight. At the age of 18, he was married to Jashodaben Modi, whom
        he abandoned soon after, only publicly acknowledging her four decades
        later when legally required to do so. Modi became a full-time worker for
        the RSS in Gujarat in 1971. The RSS assigned him to the BJP in 1985 and
        he rose through the party hierarchy, becoming general secretary in
        1998.[c] In 2001, Modi was appointed Chief Minister of Gujarat and
        elected to the legislative assembly soon after. His administration is
        considered complicit in the 2002 Gujarat riots,[d] and has been
        criticised for its management of the crisis. According to official
        records, a little over 1,000 people were killed, three-quarters of whom
        were Muslim; independent sources estimated 2,000 deaths, mostly
        Muslim.[11] A Special Investigation Team appointed by the Supreme Court
        of India in 2012 found no evidence to initiate prosecution proceedings
        against him.[e] While his policies as chief minister were credited for
        encouraging economic growth, his administration was criticised for
        failing to significantly improve health, poverty and education indices
        in the state.

        In the 2014 Indian general election, Modi led the BJP to a parliamentary
        majority, the first for a party since 1984. His administration increased
        direct foreign investment, and it reduced spending on healthcare,
        education, and social-welfare programmes. Modi began a high-profile
        sanitation campaign, controversially initiated a demonetisation of
        banknotes and introduced the Goods and Services Tax, and weakened or
        abolished environmental and labour laws. Modi's administration launched
        the 2019 Balakot airstrike against an alleged terrorist training camp in
        Pakistan. The airstrike failed,[14][15] but the action had nationalist
        appeal.[16] Modi's party won the 2019 general election which
        followed.[17] In its second term, his administration revoked the special
        status of Jammu and Kashmir,[18][19] and introduced the Citizenship
        Amendment Act, prompting widespread protests, and spurring the 2020
        Delhi riots in which Muslims were brutalised and killed by Hindu
        mobs.[20][21][22] Three controversial farm laws led to sit-ins by
        farmers across the country, eventually causing their formal repeal. Modi
        oversaw India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, during which,
        according to the World Health Organization's estimates, 4.7 million
        Indians died.[23][24] In the 2024 general election, Modi's party lost
        its majority in the lower house of Parliament and formed a government
        leading the National Democratic Alliance coalition.

        In June 1975, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared a state of emergency
        in India that lasted until 1977. During this period, known as "the
        Emergency", many of her political opponents were jailed and opposition
        groups were banned.[90][91] Modi was appointed general secretary of the
        "Gujarat Lok Sangharsh Samiti", an RSS committee co-ordinating
        opposition to the Emergency in Gujarat. Shortly afterwards, the RSS was
        banned.[92] Modi was forced to go underground in Gujarat and frequently
        travelled in disguise to avoid arrest, once dressing as a monk and once
        as a Sikh.[93] He became involved in the printing of pamphlets opposing
        the government, sending them to Delhi and organising
        demonstrations.[94][95] He was also involved with creating a network of
        safe houses for individuals who were wanted by the government, and in
        raising funds for political refugees and activists.[96] During this
        period, Modi wrote a Gujarati-language book titled Sangharsh Ma Gujarat
        (In the Struggles of Gujarat), which describes events during the
        Emergency.[97][98] While in this role, Modi met trade unionist and
        socialist activist George Fernandes and several other national political
        figures
